# Bias Mitigation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Bias Mitigation**, focusing on identifying and reducing bias in machine learning models. The project explores techniques to improve fairness while maintaining predictive performance.

## Features
- Bias detection and analysis
- Preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing mitigation techniques
- Data visualization and performance evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook implementation
- Automatic dependency installation on the first run
- Dynamic dataset download from the UCI repository using `ucimlrepo`

## Repository Contents
- `Bias Mitigation.ipynb` - The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file)

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bias-Mitigation.git
   cd Bias-Mitigation
   

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   
   jupyter notebook "Bias Mitigation.ipynb"

## Usage
Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to preprocess data, apply bias mitigation techniques, and evaluate model performance. The dataset is dynamically downloaded from the UCI repository using `ucimlrepo`, ensuring the latest version is used. Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different settings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Fairness-related libraries
